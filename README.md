# Friend, Fan, or Foe --- Instagram Edition

A small, fun side project built in R to explore basic data science skills :)

## Live App
You can try the app here: https://jkcodes.shinyapps.io/friend-fan-or-foe/ 

## How to use
Upload your Instagram Followers and Following JSON files to see:
- **Friends**: mutuals (you follow each other)
- **Fans**: they follow you, you don’t follow them back
- **Foes**: you follow them, they don’t follow you back

## Privacy note
Your data is processed only within the running app session. However, Instagram exports can contain personal information, so I recommend using this with data you’re comfortable sharing.

To make it easy to explore safely, this repo includes a **small fake sample dataset** you can download and test with.
